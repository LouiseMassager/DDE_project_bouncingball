## Features
The tracking has been realized with opencv and imutils which can be installed with pip:
```bash
python -m pip install opencv-python
python -m pip install imutils
```

## Codes description

* [DDE_tracking_with_color.ipynb](https://github.com/LouiseMassager/DDE_project_bouncingball/blob/main/tracking/DDE_tracking_with_color.ipynb) can be used to track and save the position of the center of the ball with based on its color.
* [DDE_tracking_with_shape.ipynb](https://github.com/LouiseMassager/DDE_project_bouncingball/blob/main/tracking/DDE_tracking_with_shape.ipynb) can be used to track and save the position of the center of the ball with based on its shape.
